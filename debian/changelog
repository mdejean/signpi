  * Add transit.land support to mode=subway (now a misnomer!).
  * One character routes use bullets, others (most buses) use boxes.
  * Add support for multiple stops, multiple directions, and route filter.
  * Strip out lots of unknowns from the binary, seems to still work
  * Gray out trips without real time data (is_assigned = false or no estimated)
  * Allow odd numbers of trips
  * Much refactoring
